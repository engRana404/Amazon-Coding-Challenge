# Amazon-Coding-Challenge

This is a project for the Bright Network internship experience 2022 Amazon coding challenge is aiming to implement a pathfinding algorithm on a 2D grid for self-driving delivery vehicle from a starting point (x,y) to a delivery point (x,y) and some obstacles. The vehicle can navigate to any of the adjacent squares (even diagonally), as long as the squares are inbound and do not contain an obstacle.
